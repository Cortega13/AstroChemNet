## Surrogate Modeling for Astrochemical Networks.
This package contains training/testing procedures for training deep neural network surrogate models for astrochemical networks. We use the [UCLCHEM](https://github.com/uclchem/UCLCHEM) chemical network for our datasets. Datasets are available upon request.

# User Guide
First clone the repository to use it.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Cortega13/AstroChemNet.git
```

## Initial Preprocessing
The dataset generated by me is in hdf5 file and still needs further preprocessing. For this, we therefore call the preprocessing script. The first argument referes to the dataset, which goes into the `data/` folder and the second argument referes to the preprocessing method.

```sh
python preprocess.py grav initial
```

## Model-Specific Preprocessing
For our simple autoencoder, we only care about the abundances. Therefore, we remove all data and just generate a dataset that is comprised of (samples, abundances).
```sh
python preprocess.py grav autoencoder
